# PART II | Tupler
## Herr Viktor's adventures
*Type `--help` argument to see what you have to do*
```BASH
./tupler.py --help
```
### What actually happened to Mr. Viktor ?
Now **Herr Viktor** walked over the forest, and came across a board, with the next note: 'If you solve the task, your way will be free of traps'
Mr Viktor began thinking about solving this task:
> *"We have a next task:
>     We have a tuple*
```PYTHON
 ('a','b','c','d','e','f')
```
> *We must create a list, with these kind of tuples*
```PYTHON
 [('a','b'),('c','d'),('e','f')]
```

> *Mmm, and our code have to be simple and useful, the code must have maximum 3 or 4 lines"*

**Please help Herr Viktor to solve this :)**
